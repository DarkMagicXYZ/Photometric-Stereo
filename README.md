Photometric-Stereo
==================

Straightforward implementation of calibrated photometric stereo with several
datasets.
Note that the images used in the example program are taken from the following
project page:

http://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse455/10wi/projects/project4/

The light directions are estimated with the chrome dataset inside the image
folder.

## Results

As written before the following datasets were taken from the previously linked
project page. I do not claim ownwership of the used images.
